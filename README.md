For this assignment, you will submit TWO files -- the readme and the script file. 


Edit this README file to include a brief biography of yourself. Your README should include the following elements:
* Headers (one or more)
* Emphasis (italics or/and bold)
* Lists
* Images: add a picture (of yourself or something else) to your repo and embed it in your README
* Links
* A summary and reflection of the Git/GitHub workflow you adopted for this homework, and of your experience with Markdown (e.g., provide a summary of the workflow you adopted, and add some comments about something new you learned, something that surprised you, etc.)


# INTRODUCTION

## Name
Will Fitz

## Biography

Hi everyone! 
I'm Will, an incoming MAPSS student-- concentration **Poli Sci**, aiming for the *CSS certifiicate*. I did my BA in European Studies at UVM then spent three years living in former East Germany to study populism and disaffection there, including the use of Confederate symbolism among the German far right. Since deferring from MAPSS last year I've been working at the Chicago Project on Security and Threats on projects related to the Capitol Hill insurrection, threats to federal officials, and extremist recruitment of military veterans.
I'm passionate about understanding and addressing the problems of populism and extremism, and I'm hoping to learn programming skills that would enable me to make a career researching these subjects in the intelligence sector.

Looking forward to getting to know everyone and their interests!

## Workflow

I accepted the link to the assignment repo from canvas, used git clone to clone it to my new MACS 30111 folder, then opened both items in VSC. I didn't yet know how to embed images in a Readme file, so that was new. I ended up copying the image to the local git repo then git add/commit/push-ing it to the main. I found how to embed the image on stackoverflow here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14494747/how-to-add-images-to-readme-md-on-github
This question (describe workflow) was also somewhat confusing to me, so I hope this is what it's asking for, because I guess I haven't often had to retrace my steps/ "reflect on my workflow" in a summary. I can see how it's useful though.
